Small daemon which allow to setup automatic port forwarding through most modern ADSL modems / routers.

## Script version ##

How to [Usage](Usage.md) can be found here.

Here is the first version. Uses only hardcoded port addres. For now, this project more like a hack, then good script (but works for me like a charm).

## Extension version ##

Under construction. Not yet done. (some openvpn patch, which allow upnp by default and works like a charm).
